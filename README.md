hw6: Concept Visualizer
===
For this homework assignment you will study cross-lingual relationships in Wikipedia.

Wikipedia offers encyclopedias in [287 different languages](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias), from English to Arabic to Inuktitut.
You will identify the most popular articles in each language, and uncover the articles in other
  languages that reference the same concept.

As you work on this assignment, you'll practice interacting with java Lists.
You'll create them, loop over them, and search them.

Your finished program will look like:

In this visualization, each row of boxes represents the most popular Wikipedia articles in a particular language (Simple English, Hindi, Latin).
The user of this visualization is hovering their cursor over the Hindi article for "United States", and it is highlighted in purple.
The visualization has highlighted the corresponding articles in Simple English (blue), and Latin (orange).

Your program will rely on the [wikAPIdia software library](https://github.com/shilad/wikAPIdia)
developed by Shilad, Rebecca, [Brent Hecht](http://www.brenthecht.com/), and many others.
wikAPIdia is a large, complex project, but we've created a helper class called WikapidiaWrapper
to make your life easier.

## Getting started
Fork and clone this repository.

We will setup two databases drawn from the Simple English, Latin, and Hindi Wikipedias:

 * The (full) WikAPIdia database contains all approximately 300,000 pages.
 * The small-WikAPIdia database contains a small subset of the pages (about 20,000).

You will want to use the small database to reduce the startup time of your program during testing.
However, you will ocassionaly want to revel in the glory of the full database.

If you work on lab computers:

1. Create a directory called `/Users/<your name>/wikAPIdia`
2. Copy the `/db` directory on the lab macs into the directory you created.
3. Create a directory called `/Users/<your name>/wikAPIdia-small`.
4. Download the compressed 130MB [WikAPIdia-small database](http://macademia.macalester.edu/shilad/wikAPIdiaDB.small.tar.bz2)
5. Extract the small database into the wikAPIdia-small directory (it will also contain a `db` now).

If you work on your laptop:

1. Download the compressed 1.5 GB [WikAPIdia database](http://macademia.macalester.edu/shilad/wikAPIdiaDB.tar.bz2).
2. Uncompress the file, you'll find a directory called "db"
3. Move the directory under the wikAPIdia directory with your hw6 directory. 
4. Download the compressed 130MB [WikAPIdia-small database](http://macademia.macalester.edu/shilad/wikAPIdiaDB.small.tar.bz2)
5. Extract the small database into the wikAPIdia-small directory in hw6 (it will also contain a `db` now).

The full path to the newly installed db directories should be: "some_path/hw6/wikAPIdia/db" and "some_path/hw6/wikAPIdia-small/db" 

Make sure that things are installed correctly:

1. Open `PopularArticleAnalyzer.java` in IntelliJ
2. Take a look at the `main()` method. It constructs a `WikAPIdiaWrapper` object. 
3. The `WikAPIdiaWrapper` constructor takes a String representing the `wikAPIdia` directory that contains your db directory.
Change this to make it correct.
This will be `/Users/<yourname>/wikAPIdia-small` on a lab computer, or your `hw6/wikAPIdia-small` directory on your laptop.
4. Run the class as an application (not Applet): `PopularArticleAnalyzer.main()`. 
You should see information about the [Apple article](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple) in simple English Wikipedia.

## Get to know the existing algorithmic code:

The WikAPIdia java library provides two classes you will interact with closely.

`Language` represents a distinct Language. If you need to create a new Language instance, you will typically do the following:
```java
Language simple = Language.getByLangCode("simple");
```

`LocalPage` represents a Wikipedia article in a particular language. 
For example, the concept of an apple is associated with the article 
[Apple](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple)  in simple English,
[Malum](http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malum)  in Latin, and
[Manzana](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzana) in Spanish. 
[Apple's interlanguage link table](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzana) lists the articles associated with Apple in every language.
WikAPIdia stores a different LocalPage for each of these articles.

Carefully study `WikAPIdiaWrapper`. Your code will rely heavily on it. In particular:

 * How do you get a single LocalPage?
 * How do you get all LocalPages in a language?
 * Given a LocalPage in some Language (e.g. Apple in Simple English), how do you get the LocalPages in other languages linked to that LocalPage.
 * Are there any methods that help you understand the "popularity" of a LocalPage (hint: yes).

You'll need to understand all these things to get your program to work correctly.

## Task 1: Find the most popular articles in each language.

For this task, you'll complete the getMostPopular method of the PopularityAnalyzer class.
In short, you need to:

1. Build a list capturing the popularity for each local page.
2. Sort the list you created.
3. Return a list containing the first n most popular items (read the Javadoc for sublist).
4. Add code to the `main()` method to call your new method.

Begin looping over all pages in a language and printing the popularity for each page.
You'll need to use `WikAPIdiaWrapper` for both pieces of functionality.
Note that you need to look for a measure of "popularity" provided by `WikAPIdiaWrapper`.
Since PopularityAnalyzer does not extend acm's Program, you'll need to use System.out.println to print things to the console
(note that this is the standard way Java programmers write messages to the console).

To test your method, you'll need to change the `main()` method. First, construct a `PopularityAnalyzer` instance, 
and then call its `getMostPopular` method. Run your program. You should see your messages printed to the console.

Once you are printing out your popularity scores for all articles, your next task is to capture them in a data structure and return them.
To find the most popular pages, you'll need to remember the popularity of each page.
I've given you a class called `LocalPagePopularity` that will help do this. 
It's a container for a local page and its popularity. 
In the `getMostPopular` method, create an empty list that will contain LocalPagePopularity objects.
As you iterate over the `LocalPage` objects and calculate their popularity, create a LocalPagePopularity instance and
add it to your list.

Next, you need to sort the list you created by popularity and return the most popular items.
To do this, you'll need to use `Collections.sort`, and perhaps `Collections.reverse`.
Go look at the Javadoc for these classes to see how to use them.
`Collections.sort` needs to know *how* to sort the elements in the list.
It does so by treating the objects it is sorting as `Comparable`.
Read the javadoc for Comparable, and look at this [Stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3718383/java-class-implements-comparable) about it.

Finally, enhance the `main()` method so that it prints (using System.out.println) the titles for the most popular pages in simple english.

## Task 2: Implement the text label at the top of the visualization.

Before starting this task, familiarize yourself with the graphical components in this assignment:

* `LocalPageBox` is a square representing a local page. It actually remembers the LocalPage it represents.
* `LanguageBoxes` are a container for the row of `LocalPageBox`es in a language.
* `FancyLabel` is a (possibly) multi-line label. Newlines (`"\n"` in java) force line breaks.
* `ConceptVisualizer` is the main GraphicsProgram.

For task 2, you'll create a text label describing the element the user is hovering over:

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/mac-comp124-f13/hw6/master/description.png?login=shilad&token=8940aaab03f8bd16d0a42fb6a5d1f967)

For this task, you'll complete all your work in `ConceptVisualizer` class in the `mouseMoved` event handler.

Take a look at the existing event handler. 
You'll see that the event handler now prints the page being hovered over to the console.
You'll want to construct a String describing what is happening in the visualization, and set the text in the label to it.
You'll do this in two steps. 

First, you need to retrieve the list of `LocalPage`s associated with the page being hovered over.
Look for a method to help you in `WikAPIdiaWrapper`.
Next, you'll construct a textual description of the pages associated with the concept as shown above and change the text of the label to your description.
You can insert line breaks in your description using the java newline character `"\n"`.

## Task 3: Implement highlighting on hovers

Finally, you'll highlight the box the user is hovering over, along with boxes in other languages associated with the same concept.

For this task, all your code will be in `LanguageBoxes.highlightPages` and `LanguageBoxes.unhighlight`.
Notice that these methods are already called in `ConceptVisualizer.mouseEvent`. 
You just need to make them work!

For `highlightPages` you'll need to check each box.
Retrieve the `LocalPage` associated with the box and check if the passed-in list contains it.
If it does, highlight it with the "normal" color. If not, color it gray.
I've created a method to let you set the color of a LocalPageBox to help.

The `unhighlight` method will simply restore all boxes to their "normal" color.

## Extra credit
There are many, many ways to improve this visualization or make it more beautiful. Implement one!
