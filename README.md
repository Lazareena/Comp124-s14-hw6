hw6: Concept Visualizer
===
For this homework assignment you will study cross-lingual relationships in Wikipedia.

Wikipedia offers encyclopedias in 287 different languages, from English to Arabic to Inuktitut.
You will identify the most popular articles in each language, and uncover the articles in other
  languages that reference the same concept.

Your program will rely on the [wikAPIdia software library](https://github.com/shilad/wikAPIdia)
developed by Shilad, Rebecca, and [Brent Hecht](http://www.brenthecht.com/).
wikAPIdia is a large, complex project, but we've created a helper class called WikapidiaWrapper
to make your life easier.

As you work on this assignment, you'll practice interacting with java Lists.
You'll create them, loop over them, and search them.

## Getting started
Fork and clone this repository.

If you are working on your laptop, you need to download the WikAPIdia database.
